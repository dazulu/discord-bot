Displays chat from Discord channels that your bot has joined, grouped by servers.

## Prerequisites
You will need to have [created a Discord application](https://discord.com/developers/applications/), added a bot to it, and set the _Token_ from the bot as a server side environment variable `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`. **Do not expose this token**. Finally, join some channels with the bot.
